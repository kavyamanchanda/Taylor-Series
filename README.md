# truncated-taylor-series-expansion
 Taylor series expansion of a sinusodial function
This is a project in MATLAB that plots the Taylor series expansion (truncated upto a certain number of terms input by the user) of a sinusodial function of the form A.cos(wt), where w is omea or the angular frequency.

The project has 6 phases and every phase keeps getting more orbust, effecient and easy to use.
